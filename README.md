# Javascript Simple Solutions

These exercises are based on the variables exercises, so you may start from those (your solutions or mine) or start from scratch.

## Exercise

- ### The Puppy Age Calculator

  You know how old your dog is in human years, but what about dog years? Calculate it!

  Write a function named calculateDogAge that:

        - Takes 1 argument: your puppy's age.
        -  calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.
        -  outputs the result to the screen like so: "Your doggie is NN years old in dog years!"

  Call the function three times with different sets of values.

  Bonus: Add an additional argument to the function that takes the conversion rate of human to dog years.

- ### The Lifetime Supply Calculator

  Write a function named calculateSupply that:

        - takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
        - calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
        - outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"

  Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

  Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

- ### Fibonacci Series Generator

  Write a function named fibonaci that:

        - takes 2 arguments: start_point, no_series.
        - Generate the series.
        - Fibonaci Series Of 10 Series, With Starting Numbers NN and MM. Series: NN..."

  Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

- ### The Geometrizer

  Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

  Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

        - Pass the radius to the function.
        - Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".

  Create a function called calcArea:

        - Pass the radius to the function.
        - Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

  Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.

- ### The Temperature Converter

  It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

  Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

        - Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
        - Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NNÂ°C is NNÂ°F".

  Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

        - Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
        - Convert it to celsius and output "NNÂ°F is NNÂ°C."

  Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
